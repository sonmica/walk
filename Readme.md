## Stack
The project was compiled with v21.2.0 of Node. Future versions will likely work also.
We use Vue JS with Typescript and Bootstrap in the front-end and Firebase in the back-end.

## Setup
- Clone the repository
- Run `npm install` in a terminal in the main project folder
- To run the app locally, you can use `npm run dev` in a terminal within the main project folder
- Note that all app logins are stored in Firebase
